MAFLIX is a movie recommendation system that uses a TF-IDF-based information retrieval approach combined with Rocchio feedback to provide relevant movie suggestions. The system is built using a Python Flask backend and a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend. Users can search for a movie by name, optionally filter results by genre, and receive a list of similar movies based on text similarity. The application includes an interactive feedback mechanism where users can mark movies as relevant or not relevant. This feedback is used to update the query vector using the Rocchio algorithm, improving the quality of future recommendations. The app also calculates and displays a precision score based on user feedback to evaluate how effective the recommendations are. MAFLIX supports multiple searches in one session, clearing previous feedback each time a new search is made to ensure accurate and fresh recommendations. The dataset used is a CSV file containing movie titles, genres, IMDb ratings, links, and poster information. The project emphasizes custom implementation of information retrieval techniques and provides an easy-to-use interface for exploring movies intelligently.
